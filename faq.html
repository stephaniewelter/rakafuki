    </h2>
    <p>
      The Rakafuki Friends project is an experiment in using fun design to help
      kids (and adults) engage with the abstract concept of energy efficiency.
      Each "friend" is a super-efficient LED light bulb, dressed up as a pig,
      chicken, or kangaroo. They're cool and collectible. We hope kids get
      excited and learn the benefits of energy efficiency. We also hope they
      persuade their families and neighbors to give it a try. Families will
      start saving energy and money. The Rakafuki Friends promote energy
      efficiency by emphasizing joy and imagination rather than fear. Kids don't
      need to fret about global warming, they just need to play with a paper
      pig.

      <a href="http://www.rosaparkselementary.org/">
        Rosa Parks Elementary</a> environmental science magnet
      school have lost funding for next school year. The Rosa Parks community is

    <p>
      100% of the profits from the sale of the Rakafuki Friends go to the PTA.
      That works out to $10 each, before taxes. <strong>Our goal is to raise
      $10,000.</strong> All parties involved are donating their time and
      providing materials at or below actual cost. This is a great deal and it
      helps the school.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The idea was originated by Brian Dougherty, one of the founders of
      <a href="http://celerydesign.com">Celery Design Collaborative</a>
      Brian's daughter Aiko is a third grader at Rosa Parks Elementary. She came
      up with the name and wrote the 
      <a href="#">
        theme song</a>.
      Several designers at Celery helped develop the project, especially
      Stephanie Welter, who created dozens of prototype packages and designed
      this web site.

    <p>
      Warner Phillips and the team behind the
      <a href="http://www.pharox-led.com">
        Pharox</a> light bulb have made it possible to bring this unique concept
      to reality. Pharox is the world's best-selling LED replacement bulb brand.
      The company supports several other initiatives to merge environmental
      innovation and social benefits, including 
      <a href="http://empoweredbylight.org/">

    <p>Parents and staff from Rosa Parks have generously given their time and

  <div class="question">
    <h2 id="specs" class="placeholder">
      <img src="res/title.specs.png"
        alt="What's so great about LED light bulbs?" />
    </h2>
    <p>
      LED stands for Light Emitting Diode, a semiconductor which emits light.
      LED bulbs are rapidly becoming popular replacements for incandescent and
      compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs. The Rakafuki Friends use the Pharox 400
      bulb, which is a state-of-the-art, bright, dimmable bulb. The benefits of
      this bulb include:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Long life. </strong>
      These LED bulbs are rated for 35,000 hours of operation. That's 35 times
      longer than an incandescent bulb and 8 times longer than a CFL bulb. It
      works out to ~33 years at 3 hours per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Non-toxic and recyclable.</strong> Unlike CFLs, these bulbs
      contain no mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warm white light.</strong> The Pharox 400 produces 415 lumens at
      2700K with a Color Rendering Index of 88. That's a technical way of saying that
      it's bright and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Energy efficient.</strong>
      The Pharox 400 bulb uses just 8 watts of electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dimmer friendly.</strong>
      Unlike most CFLs and other LEDs, the Pharox 400 is dimmable with select
      dimmers. The bulbs have been tested and found to be fully compatible with
      the following Leviton and Lutron dimmers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Leviton 6615-POW (300W)</li>
      <li>Leviton Decora 6611 (600VA) Magnetic low voltage</li>
      <li>Leviton 057 ACE (600W) Dimmer rotary turn On/Off</li>
      <li>Leviton 6631-LW (600W) Slide dimmer</li>
      <li>Lutron D-603PH-DK (600W) Rotary</li>
      <li>Lutron S-600PEH-WH (600W) Eco-dim makes bulbs last 3x longer</li>
      <li>Lutron DL-600PL (600W) Dalia incandescent / halogen</li>
      <li>Lutron DV-603P (600W) Diva incandescent / halogen</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="question">
    <h2 id="cost">
      <img src="res/title.cost.png"
        alt="Are LED light bulbs expensive?" />
    </h2>
    <p>LED bulbs last far longer than other bulbs, and use far less energy to
      produce equivalent light. They may cost more up front, but can save big
      money in the long run. A single LED bulb can save more than $100 over it's
      lifespan.

      Currently, all the profits for the Rakafuki Friends project support the Rosa
      Parks PTA. This is an experiment. If the project is successful, we may open it
      up to other schools in the future. Please
